# REST API Docs

Documentation for REST API

## Usage

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

### Step one

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MicroStrategy/rest-api-docs.git
```

### Step two

Install the site and run an initial build command:

```bash
cd restapi-docs
yarn
yarn start
```

This command will start a local server and you'll be able to work on your site with hot reloads and some nice Browsersync features. ðŸ’¥
