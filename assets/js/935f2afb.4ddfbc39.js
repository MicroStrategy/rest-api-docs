The system poses the prompt as a question during execution of a dossier, document, or report, and the answer determines the data that is returned. A prompt is similar to a filter; both are applied at runtime and customize the results of data that is returned from a data source. The actual prompt definition cannot be changed at runtime, but the answers to the prompt can be changed dynamically. Together with filtering, prompts allow you to build feature-rich applications by leveraging core MicroStrategy platform capabilities.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/configure-clustered-environments":{"id":"getting-started/configure-clustered-environments","title":"Configure clustered environments","description":"This page provides information for clustered environment configuration.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/embedding-sdk":{"id":"getting-started/embedding-sdk","title":"Using REST API with Embedding SDK","description":"You can use MicroStrategy REST API together with MicroStrategy Embedding SDK.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/getting-started":{"id":"getting-started/getting-started","title":"Getting started","description":"The following topics are designed to help you get started using the MicroStrategy REST API.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/handle-rest-api-exceptions":{"id":"getting-started/handle-rest-api-exceptions","title":"Handle REST API errors","description":"This page provides a guidance on designing exception workflows when using MicroStrategy REST API.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/microstrategy-rest-api-explorer":{"id":"getting-started/microstrategy-rest-api-explorer","title":"MicroStrategy REST API Explorer","description":"Instructions for using MicroStrategy REST API Explorer, our official REST API documentation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/playground":{"id":"getting-started/playground","title":"MicroStrategy REST API Playground","description":"MicroStrategy REST API Playground is a place you can see live demos of our REST API, API specifications, and code examples.
