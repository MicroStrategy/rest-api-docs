You can vary the amount of data and the timing to fit the needs of your environment. As illustrated in the diagram, you first create the model for the dataset and then create an upload session on the Intelligence Server. After the upload session has been created, you can make multiple requests to add data to the session. Once all of the data has been uploaded, you are ready to publish the dataset. You can get the publishing status of the dataset at any time. If the dataset has already been published, it is available for use. If the dataset has not been published, it is not yet ready for use; if you want to cancel the publish action, you can delete the upload session at any point before publication is complete."})]})}function m(a={}){const{wrapper:e}={...(0,i.R)(),...a.components};return e?(0,n.jsx)(e,{...a,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...a})}):d(a)}},6576:(a,e,t)=>{t.d(e,{A:()=>n});const n=t.p+"assets/images/PushDataAPIv2_workflowDiagram-c2c69c5c57d308ea2c4e0dbce8399974.jpg"},28453:(a,e,t)=>{t.d(e,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var n=t(96540);const i={},s=n.createContext(i);function o(a){const e=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof a?a(e):{...e,...a}}),[e,a])}function r(a){let e;return e=a.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof a.components?a.components(i):a.components||i:o(a.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:e},a.children)}}}]);
