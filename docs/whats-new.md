## 2019

- [Push Data API has been enhanced](./common-workflows/make-external-data-available/create-a-dataset-incrementally-with-multiple-requests/create-a-dataset-incrementally-with-multiple-requests.md).

The ability to make external data available to MicroStrategy—often referred to as the Push Data API—has been enhanced. The newest version of the Push Data API supports complex scenarios where a large number of columns/metrics need to be managed at a different update/load/refresh schedule. This is accomplished by separating dataset definition, data upload, and dataset creation, using multiple requests to incrementally add data before publication.

Performance was significantly improved for [Data import using the Push Data API (with multiple requests)](./common-workflows/filter-data/filter-data.md), and issues were addressed for stability improvements.

- [Filtering data has been enhanced](./common-workflows/filter-data/filter-data.md)

The REST API has been enhanced to support the ability to pass filters into the REST API endpoints.

- [Support for prompts has been enhanced](./common-workflows/use-prompts-objects/use-prompts-objects.md).

The REST API has been enhanced to support the ability to programmatically view, answer (with specific values, no answers, or default answers), and reset prompts on reports, dossiers, and documents.

- Exporting data has been enhanced.

The REST API now supports the export of cross-tabbed reports and report sub-totals. Additionally, the REST API has been enhanced to allow for greater scalability, so users can consume larger datasets in less time.

## 11.0

- [Filtering data](./common-workflows/filter-data/filter-data.md) has been enhanced.

The REST API has been enhanced to support the ability to pass filters into the REST API endpoints.

- A new sample has been added to [React user manager sample](./microstrategy-rest-api-samples/microstrategy-rest-api-samples.md).

## 10.11

- The stand-alone JSON Data API Server has been removed.

The [JSON Data API](./common-workflows/retrieve-data-from-the-intelligence-server/retrieve-data-from-the-intelligence-server.md) is made up of four different MicroStrategy API families. All of these families are part of the MicroStrategy REST Server, which is shipped inside the MicroStrategyLibrary.war web application.

## 10.10

- The REST API supports [sorting for cubes and reports](./common-workflows/sort-data.md).
- The JSON Data API supports [fetching data from a visualization inside an existing dossier](https://demo.microstrategy.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs/#!/Dossiers-and-Documents/getVisualizationResult) which can leverage advanced capabilities, such as the data blending engine and other complex analytics.
- The Cube API [supports DDA cubes and MDX cubes](./rest-api-families.md#CubeAPI), in addition to Intelligent cubes.

## 10.9

- The MicroStrategy REST API has been unified and expanded to include the following [REST API families](./rest-api-families.md):
  - Authentication API
  - Browsing API
  - Cubes API
  - Datasets API
  - Datasource Management API
  - Dossiers and Documents API
  - Emails API
  - Library API
  - Object Management API
  - Projects API
  - Reports API
  - Security Roles API
  - System Administration API
  - User Management API
- The /reports endpoint accepts the `requestedObjects` parameter, allowing the caller to dynamically decide which objects to include on the template when the data is returned. Previously, only the /cubes endpoint accepted the `requestedObjects` parameter. However ,there is a difference in the implementation for reports and cubes. When `requestedObjects` is null for the /reports endpoint, the result of the original template is returned and nothing is done; for the /cubes endpoint, all attributes and metrics in the working set are added to the template and the result is run.
- You can view and use all of the MicroStrategy REST API endpoints in the [MicroStrategy REST API Explorer](https://demo.microstrategy.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs/).
- Quick Start Guides illustrate how to use the MicroStrategy REST API for common workflows, including [folder browsing](./common-workflows/folder-browsing.md), [searching](./common-workflows/search-for-objects.md), creating and modifying datasets, and [exporting a document to PDF](./common-workflows/export-to-pdf.md).
- The JSON Data API and Push Data API are part of the unified MicroStrategy REST platform. This platform is contained within the MicroStrategyLibrary war file, which can be deployed to application servers.
- The current packaging of the [JSON Data API](./common-workflows/retrieve-data-from-the-intelligence-server/retrieve-data-from-the-intelligence-server.md) (jar deployment) has been deprecated. It will be supported until the next platform release.
- X-MSTR-ProjectID has been added for every endpoint to provide context. The X-MSTR-AuthToken stores a reference to all of the user's sessions in memory on the MicroStrategy REST Server, abstracting project session creation and management from the end user.
- The result format for error cases has been changed. This information is available in the [MicroStrategy REST API Explorer](https://demo.microstrategy.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs/).
- The version information included in the contentType and Accept headers has been removed.

## 10.8

There were no significant changes from the previous version.

## 10.7

- The JSON Data API content has been moved from the Web SDK and is part of the new REST API.
- A new RESTful Dataset API lets you modify a dataset that was created using the Dataset API. You can add new data and modify existing data in the dataset.

## 10.6

REST SDK content was included in the Web SDK, under the JSON Data API section, until 10.7.

- A new RESTful Dataset API lets you [upload external data directly to the Intelligence Server](./common-workflows/make-external-data-available/make-external-data-available.md).
- A new endpoint was added to the [Cube API to get the cube definition](https://demo.microstrategy.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs/#!/Cubes/getDefinition) and to the [Report API to get the report definition](https://demo.microstrategy.com/MicroStrategyLibrary/api-docs/#!/Reports/getDefinition).

## 10.5

REST SDK content was included in the Web SDK, under the JSON Data API section, until 10.7.

- A new RESTful [View filter API](./common-workflows/filter-data/filter-report-and-cube-instances/filter-report-and-cube-instances-using-view-filters/filter-report-and-cube-instances-using-view-filters.md) lets you refine the data returned from a report or cube using a variety of operators.
