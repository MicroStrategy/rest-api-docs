## What is the Playground?

MicroStrategy REST API Playground is a place you can see live demos of our REST API, API specifications, and code examples. You can also play with it without writing a single line of code.

[This GitHub Page](https://github.com/MicroStrategy/rest-api-playground) provides the instructions for you to set up and start to use it. You can access the playground at <https://www.postman.com/microstrategysdk>. If you are not familiar Postman interface, be sure to check out [the documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) on Postman's learning center.

There are two collections in the workspace:

- MicroStrategy REST API: Use it as API Documentation. It contains examples and built-in scripts to save the context information after some requests, such as `authToken`, `userId`.
- MicroStrategy REST API Workflows: It contains workflow examples. You can pick a folder and run all the requests.

You need to pick an environment to run the requests. There are two environments shipped:

- demo.microstrategy.com: It contains the connection information to the demo environment. A guest user only has limited assess to the environment, hence not all requests will pass.
- A template for cloud environment. You can make a copy and change the connection information.
