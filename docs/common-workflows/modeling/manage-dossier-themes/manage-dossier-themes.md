title: Manage dossier themes
description: A dossier theme is used to define dossier presentation styles. Once a theme is applied to a dossier, then all predefined formatting in the theme is applied to the target dossier. To create a theme object, make REST API calls to create a dossier theme instance and save it to metadata as a dossier theme object. Then the created theme object can be applied to dossier instances using specific REST APIs. You can get the information of a theme object, in a lean json format that is also used in Report Services documents (RSD or RWD).
