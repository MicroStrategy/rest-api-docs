title: Manage dashboard themes
description: A dashboard theme is used to define dashboard presentation styles. Once a theme is applied to a dashboard, then all predefined formatting in the theme is applied to the target dashboard. To create a theme object, make REST API calls to create a dashboard theme instance and save it to metadata as a dashboard theme object. Then the created theme object can be applied to dashboard instances using specific REST APIs. You can get the information of a theme object, in a lean json format that is also used in Report Services documents (RSD or RWD).
