title: Create a dataset incrementally with multiple requests
description: The newest version of the Push Data API supports complex scenarios where a large number of columns/metrics need to be managed at a different update/load/refresh schedule. This is accomplished by separating dataset definition, data upload, and dataset creation, using multiple requests to incrementally add data before publication.

The newest version of the Push Data API supports complex scenarios where a large number of columns/metrics need to be managed at a different update/load/refresh schedule. This is accomplished by separating dataset definition, data upload, and dataset creation, using multiple requests to incrementally add data before publication.

- [Logic for creating a dataset incrementally](./logic-for-creating-a-dataset-incrementally.md)
- [Create a dataset incrementally with multiple requests](./workflow-create-a-dataset-incrementally-with-multiple-requests.md)

When you use this method to create a dataset, you use the same workflow to make changes to the tables in the dataset.
