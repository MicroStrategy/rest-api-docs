Proficient in AI and analytics, our AI Expert chatbot revolutionizes how you find resources or learning materials. You can use the chat bot via REST APIs to ask the chatbot questions on a variety of topics and quickly receive personalized responses.

You can use REST API requests to consume the chat bots, such getting a bot's question list, asking a question, and asking for suggested questions.
The workflow for using bots includes the following sequence of REST API requests.

- [Get a bot's configuration](./get-bot-configuration.md)
- [Get a bot question list.](./get-bot-question-list.md)
- [Create a bot instance.](./create-a-bot-instance.md)
- [Ask for suggested questions](./ask-bot-instance-suggested-question.md)
- [Ask a bot question](./ask-bot-instance-question.md)
- [Get a bot question](./get-a-bot-question.md)
- [Delete a bot instance](./delete-a-bot-instance.md)
