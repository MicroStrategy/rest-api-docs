Various errors can occur during prompt execution. Some errors can happen with [all types of prompts](#errors-that-apply-to-all-prompt-types), and others occur only for [specific types of prompts](#prompt-specific-errors). Some causes of errors during prompt execution include:

- Incorrect input:
  - ID for the prompt does not exist in the object (dossier, document, or report)
  - Name for the prompt does not exist in the object (dossier, document, or report)
  - Attribute element or name could not be found in the attribute element list prompt
  - ID (`objectId`) for an object prompt does not exist in the metadata or could not be found
  - Answer for a value prompt is outside of the expected range
  - Answer for a value prompt is of an unexpected data type
- Issues in the workflow:
  - The caller attempts to dismiss required prompts
  - The caller attempts to answer the prompt with no answers but the prompt requires them
