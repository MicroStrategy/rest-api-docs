Starting in MicroStrategy 2021 Update 8, you can use REST API requests to retrieve, create, and update the transaction reports.

Transaction reports can be used to write-back data to the datasource. Similar to FFSQL reports, you can map an attribute form or a metric to a column of a table in the datasource. These columns will be updated once you start the transaction.

- [Create a transaction report](./create-a-transaction-report.md)
- [Retrieve a transaction report's definition](./retrieve-transaction-report-definition.md)
- [Update a transaction report's definition](./update-transaction-report-definition.md)
